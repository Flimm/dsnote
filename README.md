# Speech Note

Sailfish OS app for note taking and reading with speech to text or text to speech

## Description

**Speech Note** converts:

- speech to text using [Coqui STT](https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT),
[Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk) and [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) engines and language models, also
- text to speech with [espeak-ng](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng) and 
[Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) engines.

All voice processing is entirely done locally on the device. Internet connection is only
required for model download during app initial configuration. **Speech Note** respects your
privacy and does not send any data to the Internet.

## Languages and Models

<sup>(e) experimental, most likely doesn't work well</sup>

Language models can be downloaded directly from the app.

Details of models which are currently configured for download are described in
[models.json](https://github.com/mkiol/dsnote/blob/main/config/models.json).

The quality of speech recognition strongly depends on a model.

## Systemd service and D-Bus API

**Speech Note** provides systemd service (`harbour-dsnote`) for speech-to-text/text-to-speech conversion.
This service is accessible via D-Bus interface. The detailed API description is in
[org.mkiol.Speech.xml](https://github.com/mkiol/dsnote/blob/main/dbus/org.mkiol.Speech.xml) document.

An example of QML-only and easy to re-use component that encapsulate complexity of D-Bus
interface is [SttService.qml](https://github.com/mkiol/dskeyboard/blob/main/qml/SttService.qml)
(from [Speech Keyboard](https://github.com/mkiol/dskeyboard) project).
